# v0.5
## 08/11/2025
Remembered I had a Git to upload this to. I don't even remember what changes I've made since then, but off the top of my head: ability to add an alt comment to comic image, several adjustments to make the code look better, and now the JS keyboard navigation won't kick in when you're trying to write a comment on a text field.

3. Various little fixes.
